G47.92 Intermediation service activities for specialised retail sale
This class includes intermediation service activities for specialised retail sale that facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers for the ordering and/or delivering of physical goods for a fee or commission, without supplying and taking ownership of the goods that are intermediated.
These intermediation activities can be carried out on digital platforms or through non-digital channels (including face-to-face, door-to-door, telephone, mail, and so on.).
The fee or commission can be received from either the buyers or sellers.
Revenue for intermediation service activities for specialised retail sale can include other sources of income (for example, revenues from the sale of advertising space).
This class excludes:
- retail sale of petrol in combination with electro fuels (e-fuels), if the sale of electro fuels is not predominant, see 47.30
- intermediation service activities for non-specialised retail sale, see 47.91
