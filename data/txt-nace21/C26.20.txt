C26.20 Manufacture of computers and peripheral equipment
This class includes the manufacture and/or assembly of electronic computers (for example, mainframes, desktop computers, laptops, computer servers); computer peripheral equipment (for example, storage devices, input/output devices, such as printers, monitors, keyboards).
Computers can be analogue, digital, or hybrid.
Digital computers, the most common type, are devices that do all of the following: (1) store the processing program or programs and the data immediately necessary for the execution of a program, (2) can be freely programmed in accordance with the requirements of the user, (3) perform arithmetical computations specified by the user and (4) execute, without human intervention, a processing program that requires the computer to modify its execution by logical decision during the processing run.
Analogue computers are capable of simulating mathematical models and comprise at least analogue control and programming elements.
This class includes:
- manufacture of desktop computers
