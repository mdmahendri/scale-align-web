F43.60 Intermediation service activities for specialised construction services
This class includes the intermediation for specialised construction services by bringing clients and service providers together for a fee or commission, without the intermediary providing the specialised construction services that are intermediated.
These intermediation activities can be carried out on digital platforms or through non-digital channels (including face-to-face, door-to-door, telephone, post, and so on).
The fee or commission can be received from either the client or the provider of the specialised construction service.
Revenue for the intermediation activities can include other sources of income (for example, revenues from the sale of advertising space).
