C19 Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products
This division includes the transformation of crude petroleum and coal into usable products.
The dominant process is petroleum refining, which involves the separation of crude petroleum into component products through such techniques as cracking and distillation.
This division includes the manufacture of gases (for example, ethane, propane, butane) as products of petroleum refineries.
This division also includes the manufacture for own account of characteristic products (for example, coke, butane, propane, petrol, kerosene, fuel oil) as well as processing services (for example, custom refining).
This division excludes the manufacture of such gases in other units (see 20.14), the manufacture of industrial gases (see 20.11), the extraction of natural gas (methane, ethane, butane or propane, see 06.20), and the manufacture of gases other than petroleum gases for the provision of gaseous fuels through a permanent supply network (for example, coal gas, water gas, producer gas, gasworks gas, see 35.21).
The manufacture of petrochemicals from refined petroleum and the manufacture of liquid biofuels are classified in division 20.
