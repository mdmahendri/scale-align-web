H52.32 Intermediation service activities for passenger transportation
This class includes the intermediation of passenger transport, by bringing clients and service providers together for a fee or commission, without the intermediary providing the passenger transport services that are intermediated.
These intermediation activities can be carried out on digital platforms or through non-digital channels (including face-to-face, door-to-door, telephone, mail, and so on).
The fee or commission can be received from either the client or the provider of the passenger transport service.
