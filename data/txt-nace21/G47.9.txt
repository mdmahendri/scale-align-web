G47.9 Intermediation service activities for retail sale
This group includes intermediation service activities for specialised and non-specialised retail sale that facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers of physical goods for a fee or commission, without supplying and taking ownership of the goods that are intermediated.
These intermediation activities can be carried out on digital platforms or through non-digital channels (including face-to-face, door-to-door, telephone, mail, and so on).
The fee or commission can be received from either the buyers or sellers.
Revenue for intermediation service activities for retail sale can include other sources of income (for example, revenues from the sale of advertising space).
This group also includes:
- activities of intermediaries in the retail sale of second-hand goods
- activities of retail auctioneering houses for both new and used third-party goods, including internet retail auctions
- activities of agents for the retail sale of motor vehicles and motorcycles
