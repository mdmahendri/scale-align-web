A01 Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities
This division includes two basic activities, namely the production of crop products and the production of animal products.
Mixed farming (group 01.5) breaks with the usual principles for identifying the main activity.
It accepts that many agricultural units have a reasonably balanced production of crops and animals, and that it would be arbitrary to classify them in one category or the other.
This division includes the soilless cultivation of crops, such as using hydroponic and aquaponic methods.
This division also includes service activities incidental to agriculture, as well as hunting, trapping and related activities.
Agricultural activities exclude any subsequent processing of the agricultural products (classified under divisions 10, 11 and 12), beyond that needed to prepare them for the primary markets.
The preparation of products for the primary markets is included here.
This division excludes field construction (for example, agricultural land terracing, drainage, preparing rice paddies) classified in section F and buyers and cooperative associations engaged in the marketing of farm products classified in section G. Also excluded are landscape service activities, which are classified in class 81.30.
