A03.2 Aquaculture
This group includes aquaculture (or aquafarming), in other words, the production process involving the culturing or farming (including harvesting) of aquatic organisms (for example, fish, molluscs, crustaceans, plants, amphibians) using techniques designed to increase the production of the organisms in question beyond the natural capacity of the environment (for example, regular stocking, feeding and protection from predators).
Aquaculture also encompasses individual, corporate or state ownership of the individual organisms throughout the rearing or culture stage, up to and including harvesting.
Culturing/farming refers to the rearing up to their juvenile and/or adult phase under captive conditions of the above organisms.
This group also includes:
