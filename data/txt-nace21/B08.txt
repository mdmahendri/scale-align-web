B08 Other mining and quarrying
This division includes extraction from a mine or quarry, but also dredging of alluvial deposits, rock crushing and the use of salt marshes.
The products are used most notably in construction (for example, sands, stones), the manufacture of materials (for example, clay, gypsum, calcium), the manufacture of chemicals, and so on.
This division excludes processing (except crushing, grinding, cutting, cleaning, drying, sorting and mixing) of the minerals extracted, see section C.
