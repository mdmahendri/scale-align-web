C20.14 Manufacture of other organic basic chemicals
This class includes the manufacture of chemicals using basic processes (for example, thermal cracking, distillation).
The output of these processes is usually separate chemically defined organic compounds.
This class includes:
- manufacture of basic organic chemicals:
acyclic hydrocarbons, saturated and unsaturated
cyclic hydrocarbons, saturated and unsaturated
acyclic and cyclic alcohols
mono- and polycarboxylic acids, including acetic acid
other oxygen-function compounds, including aldehydes, ketones, quinones and dual or poly oxygen-function compounds
synthetic glycerol
nitrogen-function organic compounds, including amines
fermentation of sugar cane, corn or similar to produce alcohol and esters
other organic compounds, including wood distillation products (e.g. charcoal), etc.
- manufacture of synthetic aromatic products
- manufacture of methane, not for the provision as a gaseous fuel through a permanent supply network
- distillation of coal tar
- manufacture of ethyl alcohol, other than for bioethanol fuel
- manufacture of refrigerant gases
This class excludes:
- extraction of natural gas, consisting predominantly of methane, see 06.20
- manufacture of plastics in primary forms, see 20.16
- manufacture of synthetic rubber in primary forms, see 20.17
- manufacture of crude glycerol, see 20.41
- manufacture of liquid biofuels (e.g. bioethanol fuel), see 20.51
- manufacture of natural essential oils, see 20.59
- manufacture of salicylic and O-acetylsalicylic acids, see 21.10
- manufacture of ethanol from biomass, see 20.51
- production of methane for the provision as a gaseous fuel through a permanent supply network, see 35.21
