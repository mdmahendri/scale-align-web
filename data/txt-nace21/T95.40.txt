This class includes intermediation for the repair and maintenance of computers, personal and household goods, motor vehicles and motorcycles by bringing clients and service providers together for a fee or commission, without the intermediary providing the services intermediated.
These intermediation activities can be carried out on digital platforms or through non-digital channels (including face-to-face, door-to-door, telephone, telephone, mail, and so on).
The fee or commission can be received from either the client or the provider of the repair and maintenance service.
