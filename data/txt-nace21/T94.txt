T94 Activities of membership organisations
This division includes activities of organisations representing interests of special groups or promoting ideas to the general public.
These organisations usually have a constituency of members, but their activities may involve and benefit non-members as well.
The primary breakdown of this division is determined by the purpose that these organisations serve, namely interests of employers, self-employed individuals and professional groups (group 94.1), interests of employees (group 94.2) or the promotion of religious, political, cultural, educational or recreational ideas and activities (group 94.9).
