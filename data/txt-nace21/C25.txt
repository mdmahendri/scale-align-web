C25 Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment
This division includes the manufacture of pure metal products (for example, parts, containers, structures), usually with a static, immovable function.
This is in contrast to divisions 26 to 30, which cover the manufacture of combinations or assemblies of such metal products (sometimes with other materials) into more complex units that unless they are purely electrical, electronic or optical work with moving parts.
This division also includes the manufacture of products of composite materials in which metals are the predominant material.
The manufacture of weapons and ammunition is also included in this division.
This division excludes:
- specialised repair and maintenance activities of fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment, see 33.1
- specialised installation of manufactured goods produced in this division in buildings (e.g. central heating boilers), see 43.22
