I56 Food and beverage service activities
This division includes food and beverage serving activities providing meals or drinks fit for immediate consumption, whether in traditional restaurants, self-service or takeaway restaurants, whether permanent or temporary, with or without seating.
The fact that meals fit for immediate consumption are offered is decisive, not the kind of facility providing them.
This division excludes:
- the production of meals not fit for immediate consumption or not planned to be consumed immediately, or of prepared food which is not considered to be a meal, see divisions 10 and 11
- the sale of not self-manufactured food that is not considered to be a meal, or of meals that are not fit for immediate consumption, see section G
- coffee dispenser and vending machines selling food and drinks prepared by the machine itself, see division 47
