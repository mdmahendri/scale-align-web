H50 Water transport
This division includes the water transport of passengers or freight, whether scheduled or not, whether for professional, personal or recreational reasons.
Also included are the operation of towing or pushing boats, excursion or sightseeing boats, cruise ships, ferries, water taxis, and so on.
Although the location is an indicator for the separation between sea and inland water transport, the deciding factor is the type of vessel used.
Transport on seagoing vessels is classified in groups 50.1 and 50.2, while transport using other vessels is classified in groups 50.3 and 50.4.
This division excludes restaurant and bar activities aboard ships, if carried out by separate units, see 56.11, 56.30.
