A03.1 Fishing
This group includes capture fishery, in other words, the harvesting, collecting and gathering activities directed at removing or collecting live wild aquatic organisms (predominantly fish, molluscs and crustaceans), including plants from the oceanic, coastal or inland waters for human consumption and other purposes by hand or more usually by various types of fishing gear (for example, nets, lines, stationary traps).
Such activities can be conducted on the intertidal zones (for example, the collection of molluscs, such as mussels, oysters), coastal waters or offshore waters.
These activities also include fishing in restocked water bodies.
