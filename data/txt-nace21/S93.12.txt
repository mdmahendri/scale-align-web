S93.12 Activities of sports clubs
This class includes the activities of sports clubs, which, whether professional, semi-professional or amateur clubs, give their members the opportunity to engage in sporting activities.
Sports clubs are typically non-profit entities, but inclusion in the sports sector is legitimised by the prevailing purpose of the activity carried out (in other words, the promotion of practicing sports).
The activities of education, training, the sale of advertising space and the provision of clubhouse services are, in this context, ancillary activities, which may have a prevailing weight at an economic level, but which are instrumental with respect to the prevailing purpose of the activity carried out and for its perpetuation.
This class includes:
- operation of sports clubs, e.g.:
football clubs
bowling clubs
swimming clubs
golf clubs
boxing clubs
winter sports clubs
chess clubs
track and field clubs
shooting clubs
e-sports clubs
card game clubs (e.g. bridge clubs)
