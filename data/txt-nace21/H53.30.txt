H53.30 Intermediation service activities for postal and courier activities
This class includes the intermediation of postal and courier activities, by bringing clients and service providers together for a fee or commission, without the intermediary providing the postal and courier services that are intermediated.
These intermediation activities can be carried out on digital platforms or through non-digital channels (including face-to-face, door-to-door, telephone, mail, and so on).
The fee or commission can be received from either the client or the provider of the postal and courier service.
Revenue for the intermediation activities can include other sources of income (for example, revenues from the sale of advertising space).
This class includes:
- any intermediation service undertaken by third parties to postal service providers and offered to business and domestic (household) clients
- operation of online platforms to allow people to book a food delivery
This class excludes:
- food delivery services, see 53.20
- operation of online platforms for home delivery of prepared meals, if the delivery is carried out by the same unit which prepares the meals, see 56.40
- monetary intermediation services (e.g. payment of fees through the post office), see 64.19
