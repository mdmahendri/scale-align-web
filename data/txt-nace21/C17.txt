C17 Manufacture of paper and paper products
This division includes the manufacture of pulp, paper, converted paper and the manufacture of products of recycled goods from wood, paper, cardboard and paperboard.
The manufacture of these products is grouped together because they constitute a series of vertically connected processes.
More than one activity is often carried out in a single unit.
The manufacture of pulp involves separating the cellulose fibres from other matter in wood, or dissolving and de-inking of used paper, and mixing in small amounts of reagents to reinforce the binding of the fibres.
Converted paper products are made from paper and other materials by various techniques.
The paper articles may be printed (for example, wallpaper, gift wrap), as long as the printing of information is not the main purpose.
The production of pulp, paper and paperboard in bulk is included in group 17.1, while the remaining classes include the production of further-processed paper and paper products.
