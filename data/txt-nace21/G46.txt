G46 Wholesale trade
This division includes wholesale of physical goods on own account or on a fee or contract basis (commission trade) related to domestic (national) wholesale as well as international wholesale (import/export), including on the internet.
Wholesale on own account means owning the goods traded until the ownership is transferred to the buyer.
In the case of transit trade, the goods are commissioned by a buyer, but the agent owns the goods while they are in transit.
However, both cases are classified the same way (groups 46.2 to 46.9).
This division includes wholesale on a fee or contract basis (group 46.1), specialised wholesale (groups 46.2 to 46.8) and non-specialised wholesale (group 46.9); class 46.39 is an exception as it includes non-specialised wholesale of food, beverages and tobacco.
The rules for defining specialised and non-specialised wholesale activities are described in paragraphs xxxx of the introductory guidelines.
This division also includes:
- wholesale of motor vehicles and motorcycles, and related parts, equipment and accessories
- transit trade activities
