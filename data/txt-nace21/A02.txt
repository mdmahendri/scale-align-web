A02 Forestry and logging
This division includes silviculture and the production of roundwood as well as the extraction and gathering of wild-growing non-wood forest products.
Besides the production of timber, forestry activities result in products that undergo little processing, for example, firewood, charcoal or roundwood used in an unprocessed form (such as pit-props or pulpwood).
These activities can be carried out in natural, semi-natural or planted forests.
Excluded is further processing of wood beginning with sawmilling and planing of wood, see division 16.
