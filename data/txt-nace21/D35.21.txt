This class includes:
- production of gaseous fuels for energy supply through a gas distribution network (e.g. by carbonation of coal, gasification of lignite, electrolysis or methanisation)
- production of gaseous fuels for energy supply with a specified calorific value, by purification, blending and other processes from gases of various types, including natural gas or hydrogen
- production of biogas for the purpose of gas supply (e.g. from sewage sludge, manure, waste)
- production of gaseous biofuels for energy supply through a gas distribution network
This class also includes:
