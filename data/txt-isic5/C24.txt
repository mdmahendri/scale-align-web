C24 Manufacture of basic metals
This division includes the activities of smelting and/or refining ferrous and non-ferrous metals from ore, pig, metal waste or scrap, using electrometallurgic and other process metallurgic techniques
This division also includes the manufacture of metal alloys and super-alloys by introducing other
chemical elements to pure metals.
The output of smelting and refining, usually in ingot form, is used in rolling, drawing and extruding operations to make products such as plate, sheet, strip, bars, rods, wire or tubes, pipes and hollow profiles, and in molten form to make castings and other basic metal products.
