A0150 Mixed farming
This class includes the combined production of crops and animals without a specialised production of crops or animals.
The size of the overall farming operation is not a determining factor.
If, for example, either production of crops or animals in a given unit is 66% or more of standard output, the combined activity should not be included here, but allocated to crop or animal farming.
This class excludes:
- mixed crop farming, see groups 011 and 012
- mixed animal farming, see group 014
