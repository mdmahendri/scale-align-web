C10 Manufacture of food products
This division includes the processing of the products of agriculture, forestry and fishing into food for humans or animals, and includes the production of various intermediate products that are not directly food products.
The activity often generates associated products of greater or lesser value (for example, hides from slaughtering, or oilcake from oil production).
This division is organised by activities dealing with different kinds of products: meat, fish, fruit and vegetables, fats and oils, milk products, grain mill products, animal feeds and other food products.
Production can be carried out for own account, as well as for third parties, as in custom slaughtering.
Some activities are considered manufacturing (for example, those performed in bakeries, pastry shops, and prepared meat shops etc. which sell their own production) even though there is retail sale of the products in the producers' own shop.
However, where the processing is minimal and does not lead to a real transformation, the unit is classified to wholesale and retail trade (section G).
This division includes also the manufacture of liquids considered food or that use similar manufacturing processes e.g. milk and fruit juice or concentrate.
This division excludes:
The preparation of meals for immediate consumption, see division 56
