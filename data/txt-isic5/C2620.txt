C2620 Manufacture of computers and peripheral equipment
This class includes the manufacture and/or assembly of electronic computers, such as mainframes, desktop computers, laptops and computer servers; and computer peripheral equipment, such as storage devices and input/output devices (printers, monitors, keyboards).
Computers can be analog, digital, or hybrid.
Digital computers, the most common type, are devices that do all of the following: (1) store the processing program or programs and the data immediately necessary for the execution of the program, (2) can be freely programmed in accordance with the requirements of the user, (3) perform arithmetical computations specified by the user and (4) execute, without human intervention, a processing program that requires the computer to modify its execution by logical decision during the processing run.
Analog computers are capable of simulating mathematical models and comprise at least analog control and programming elements.
