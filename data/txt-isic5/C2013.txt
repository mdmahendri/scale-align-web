C2013 Manufacture of plastics and synthetic rubber in primary forms
This class includes the manufacture of resins, plastics materials and non-vulcanizable thermoplastic elastomers, the mixing and blending of resins on a custom basis, as well as the manufacture of non-customized synthetic resins.
This class includes:
- manufacture of plastics in primary forms:
* polymers, including those of ethylene, propylene, styrene, vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate and acrylics
* polyamides
* phenolic and epoxide resins and polyurethanes
* alkyd and polyester resins and polyethers
* silicones
* ion-exchangers based on polymers
- manufacture of synthetic rubber in primary forms:
* synthetic rubber
* factice
- manufacture of mixtures of synthetic rubber and natural rubber or rubber-like gums (e.g. balata)
This class also includes:
- manufacture of cellulose and its chemical derivatives
- manufacture of plastics powders, granules or flakes by compounding or reformulating plastics resins from recovered plastic waste
- manufacture of recycled plastic by flaking and/or pelletising pre-treated plastic waste following material recovery operations
- remelting of plastics to produce granulates or compounds
This class excludes:
- manufacture of artificial and synthetic fibres, filaments and yarn, see 2030- processing of shredding, cleaning, melting, grinding of plastic waste, see 3830- pelleting of plastic to produce secondary raw materials for tubes, flower pots, pallets and the like, see 3830
- sorting, shredding, cleaning, grinding and pelletising of rubber waste, see 3830
