Q8561 Intermediation service activities for courses and tutors
This class includes the intermediation service activities for courses and tutors by bringing clients and service providers together for a fee or commission, without the intermediary providing the instruction or tutoring services intermediated.
These intermediation activities can be carried out on digital platforms or through non-digital channels (face-to-face including door-to-door, phone, mail, etc.).
The fee or commission can be received from either the client or the provider of instruction or tutoring.
Revenue for the intermediation activities can include other sources of income, such as revenues from sale of advertising space.
