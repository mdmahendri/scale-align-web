E3830 Materials and other waste recovery
This class includes:
- processing of metal and non-metal waste and scrap and other articles into secondary raw materials, usually involving a mechanical or chemical transformation process
- recovery of materials from waste streams in the form of:
separating and sorting recoverable materials from non-hazardous waste streams (i.e. garbage)
separating and sorting of commingled recoverable materials, such as paper, plastics, used beverage cans and metals, into distinct categories
Examples of the mechanical or chemical transformation processes that are undertaken are:
- mechanical crushing of metal waste such as used cars, washing machines, bikes etc. with subsequent sorting and separation
- dismantling of automobiles, computers, televisions and other equipment for materials recovery
- mechanical reduction of large iron pieces such as railway wagons
- shredding of metal waste, end-of-life vehicles etc.
- other methods of mechanical treatment as cutting, pressing to reduce the volume
- ship-breaking
- reclaiming metals out of photographic waste, e.g. fixer solution or photographic films and paper
- reclaiming of rubber such as used tires to produce secondary raw material
- sorting and mechanical processing (e.g. cleaning, grinding) of plastics to produce secondary raw material
- processing (cleaning, melting, grinding) of plastic or rubber waste to granulates
- processing (aging, cleaning, sorting) of incineration bottom ash into secondary raw materials (metals, aggregates)
- crushing, cleaning and sorting of glass
- crushing, cleaning and sorting of other waste such as demolition waste to obtain secondary raw material
- recovery of waste oil, processing of used cooking oils and fats into secondary raw materials
- processing of other food, beverage and tobacco waste and residual substances into secondary raw materials
This class excludes:
- manufacture of new final products from secondary metal raw materials (whether or not self-produced), such as spinning yarn from garnetted stock, making pulp from paper waste, retreading tyres or production of metal from metal scrap, see corresponding classes in section C (Manufacturing)
