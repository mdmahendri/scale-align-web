A02 Forestry and logging
This division includes silviculture and the production of roundwood as well as the extraction and gathering of wild growing non-wood forest products.
Besides the production of timber, forestry activities result in products that undergo little processing, such as firewood, charcoal and roundwood used in an unprocessed form (e.g. pit-props, pulpwood).
These activities can be carried out in natural, semi-natural or planted forests.
This class excludes:
further processing of wood beginning with sawmilling and planing of wood, see division 16.
