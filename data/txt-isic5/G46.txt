G46 Wholesale trade
This division includes wholesale trade of physical goods on own account or on a fee or contract basis (commission trade) related to domestic wholesale trade as well as international wholesale trade (import/export), including on the Internet.
Wholesale trade on own account means owning the goods traded until the ownership is transferred to the buyer.
In the case of transit trade, the goods are commissioned by a buyer, but the agent owns the goods while they are in transit, however both cases are classified the same way (groups 462-469).
This division includes wholesale on a fee or contract basis (group 461), specialised wholesale (groups 462-467) and non- specialised wholesale (group 469); class 4630 is an exception as it includes non-specialised wholesale of food, beverages and tobacco.
