F4340 Intermediation service activities for specialized construction services
This class includes the intermediation for specialised construction services by bringing clients and service providers together for a fee or commission, without the intermediary providing the specialised construction services that are intermediated.
These intermediation activities can be carried out on digital platforms or through non-digital channels (face-to-face, phone, post, etc.).
The fee or commission can be received from either the client or the provider of the specialised construction services.
Revenue for the intermediation activities can include other sources of income, such as revenues from advertising.
This class excludes other non-intermediation specialized construction services.
