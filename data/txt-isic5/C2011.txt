C2011 Manufacture of basic chemicals
This class includes the manufacture of chemicals using basic processes, such as thermal cracking and distillation.
The output of these processes are usually separate chemical elements or separate chemically defined compounds.
This class includes:
- manufacture of liquefied or compressed inorganic industrial or medical gases:
* elemental gases
* liquid or compressed air
* refrigerant gases
* mixed industrial gases
* inert gases such as carbon dioxide
* isolating gases
- manufacture of dyes and pigments from any source in basic form or as concentrate
- manufacture of chemical elements
- manufacture of inorganic acids except nitric acid
- manufacture of alkalis, lyes and other inorganic bases except ammonia
- manufacture of other inorganic compounds
- manufacture of basic organic chemicals:
* acyclic hydrocarbons, saturated and unsaturated
* cyclic hydrocarbons, saturated and unsaturated
* acyclic and cyclic alcohols
* mono- and polycarboxylic acids, including acetic acid
* other oxygen-function compounds, including aldehydes, ketones, quinones and dual or poly oxygen-function compounds
* synthetic glycerol
* nitrogen-function organic compounds, including amines
* fermentation of sugarcane, corn or similar to produce alcohol and esters
* other organic compounds, including wood distillation products (e.g. charcoal) etc.
- manufacture of distilled water
- manufacture of synthetic aromatic products
- roasting of iron pyrites
- distillation of coal tar
This class also includes:
- manufacture of products of a kind used as fluorescent brightening agents or as luminophores
- manufacture of methane, not for the provision as a gaseous fuel through a permanent supply network
- manufacture of ethyl alcohol, other than for bioethanol fuel
- enrichment of uranium and thorium ores and production of fuel elements for nuclear reactors
- manufacture of lithium hydroxide
This class excludes:
- extraction of methane, ethane, butane or propane, see 0620
- extraction of natural gas, consisting predominately of methane, see 0620
- liquefaction and regasification of natural gas for purpose of transport, done at the mine site, see 0910

- manufacture of prepared dyes and pigments, see 2022
- manufacture of crude glycerol, see 2023
- manufacture of natural essential oils, see 2029
- manufacture of aromatic distilled waters, see 2029
- manufacture of liquid biofuels, e.g. bioethanol fuel, see 2029
- manufacture of ethanol from biomass, see 2029
- manufacture of salicylic and O-acetylsalicylic acids, see 2100
- production of methane for the provision as a gaseous fuel through a permanent supply network, see 3520
