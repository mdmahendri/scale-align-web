C16 Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials
This division includes the manufacture of wood products, e.g. lumber, plywood, veneers, wood containers, wood flooring, wood trusses, prefabricated wood buildings, the manufacture of solid fuels from vegetable biomass and the finishing of wooden products.
The production processes include sawing, planing, shaping, laminating, and assembling of wood products starting from logs that are cut into bolts, or lumber that may then be cut further, or shaped by lathes or other shaping tools.
The lumber or other transformed wood shapes may also be subsequently planed or smoothed, and assembled into finished products, e.g. wood containers.
With the exception of sawmilling, this division is subdivided mainly based on the specific products manufactured.
This division excludes:
- manufacture of wooden furniture, see 3101
- installation of wooden fittings and the like, see 4330
