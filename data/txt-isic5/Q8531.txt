Q8531 General secondary education
This class includes provision of the type of education that lays the foundation for lifelong learning and human development and is capable of furthering education opportunities.
Activities classified in this class are based on programmes that are usually on a more subject-oriented pattern using more specialised teachers, and more often employ several teachers conducting classes in their field of specialisation.

This class includes:
- lower general secondary education corresponding more or less to compulsory school age
- upper general secondary education, whether granting access or not to higher education
This class excludes:
- non-formal education and training, see 855
