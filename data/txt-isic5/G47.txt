G47 Retail trade
This division includes the resale (sale without transformation or after minor alterations or usual handling such as reconditioning) of new and used physical goods to the general public for personal or household consumption or utilisation, by shops, department stores, consumer cooperatives, stalls, mail-order houses, internet, door-to-door sales persons, hawkers etc.
This division includes retail trade of new and used motor vehicles and motorcycles including electrical vehicles.
The classification of retail trade activities is done based on traded good and not according to the way of selling (in store, on-line, via stall and market etc.).
Retail trade activities are divided into specialised retail trade activities (groups 472 to 478) and non-specialised retail trade activities (group 471).
Retail trade includes the retail sale of second-hand goods (class 4774).
The above groups are further subdivided by the range of products sold.
The goods sold in this division are limited to goods usually referred to as consumer goods or retail goods.
Therefore, goods not normally entering the retail trade, such as cereal grains, ores, industrial machinery etc. are excluded.
Distribution of digital products, including downloading and streaming services is also excluded.
This division also includes units engaged primarily in selling to the general public, from displayed merchandise, products such as personal computers, stationery, paint or timber, although these products may not be for personal or household use.
Handling that is customary in trade does not affect the basic character of the merchandise and may include, for example, sorting, separating, mixing and packaging, delivery and installation of goods as well as sales promotion for their customers, if supplied by the same trader.
