C282 Manufacture of special-purpose machinery
This group includes the manufacture of special-purpose machinery, i.e. machinery for exclusive use in an ISIC industry or a small cluster of ISIC industries.
While most of these are used in other manufacturing processes, such as food manufacturing or textile manufacturing, this group also includes the manufacture of machinery specific for other (non-manufacturing industries), such as aircraft launching gear or amusement park equipment.
